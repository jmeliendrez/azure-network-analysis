# ðŸ¦ˆ Network Analysis using WireShark
After setting up 2 VMs, I begin filtering traffic using WireShark to then look at and analyse.

## Installing WireShark

This is pretty simple. Go to the [WireShark Download](https://www.wireshark.org/#download) page and select the appropriate version for your system. In my case it was the "Windows Installer (64-bit)". 

Once downloaded, run the file by double clicking.

Make sure to install Npcap as well but don't worry about install the USB (reader?) as this requires physical access to the machine, which we don't have. 

Once WireShark is installed open it up. 

Make sure that you have eth0 selected. 

Then select the blue fin at the top left of the screen to begin analysing network traffic. 

## ICMP


## SSH


## DHCP


## DNS


## RDP
